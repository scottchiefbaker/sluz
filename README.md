# 📰 Sluz PHP templating system

Sluz is a minimalistic PHP templating engine with an emphasis on
syntax similar to [Smarty](https://www.smarty.net/). This allows
you to separate your logic (`.php`) and your presentation (`.stpl`)
files.

The goal of Sluz is to be a **small**, single PHP source file, that
emulates simple Smarty-like syntax.

## 📦 Getting started

File: `script.php`
```php
include('/path/to/sluz/sluz.class.php');
$s = new sluz();

$s->assign("name", "Jason");
$s->assign("version", "0.3");

print $s->fetch("tpls/script.stpl");
```

File: `tpls/script.stpl`
```
<h1>Hello {$name}</h1>

<div>Welcome to Sluz version: {$version}</div>
```

## 📐 Requirements

Sluz is a zero-dependency library. **Only** the `sluz.class.php` is
needed for the library to function.

## 🥽 Testing

Sluz has an extensive test suite that is used to verify compatibility
across PHP versions. As of this writing Sluz passes all unit tests on
PHP versions: 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5.

To run the tests issue this command at the CLI:

```
php unit_tests/tests.php
```

**Note:** Care was take to ensure that no `E_NOTICE` warnings are emitted
to insure Sluz is `error_reporting(E_ALL)` compliant.

## 📖 Documentation

There is extensive documentation in the `docs/` with real world examples of the syntax.

## 🔤 Naming

Sluz is pronounced "sloos". The name comes from the "S" in Smarty
and "luz" which is Spanish for light. Sluz is a lite, Smarty-like
templating system.
